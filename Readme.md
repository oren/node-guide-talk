Migrating Large Codebase - From a Ball of Mud to JavaScript Poetry

YP.com is the largest Ruby shop in LA. Two month ago we started migrating from Ruby to Node.js.
What challenges are we dealing with and how are we solving them?
In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase. 
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately, even for a new codebase.

Agenda (if time permits)

* Web frameworks fight! Express vs Hapi vs http.createServer
* Control Flow - Callbacks vs Promises
* Client side code - CommonJS vs AMD
* Code style - OO vs Functional
* Dealing with legacy code - Migration Strategy
* Error handling - Domains?


I need help with a name for a coming talk. it's about decisions we had to make while building a full-stack js app. things like web framework, oo vs functional style, control-flow aproach, organizing the client-side etc.
Here are some ideas for a name - 2. A Guide to Navigate the Node Jungle  2. The Hitchhiker's Guide to Node  3. 2013: A JavaScript Odyssey - one company's journey to Node


Ideas for name of the talk:
1. A Guide to Navigate the Node Jungle
2. The Hitchhiker's Guide to Node
3. 2013: A JavaScript Odyssey - one company's journey to Node

YP.com is the largest Ruby shop in LA. 
A few months ago we started migrating from Ruby to Node.js.
Full-stack JavaScript app opens-up new possibilities but it 
also comes with a price - many quick in-flight decisions: 
Which web framework to use if any? How to organize our 
client-side codebase? Should we write in Object Oriented or 
functional style? What's the best way to migrate big ball of 
mud into JavaScript poetry?

In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase.
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately to any JavaScript developer.
