# Don't Panic - The Hitchhiker's Guide to Node

YP.com is the largest Ruby shop in LA. A few months ago we started migrating a large codebase from Ruby to Node.js.

Full-stack JavaScript application opens up new possibilities but it also adds a challenge of making many in-flight decisions, such as the following: Should we use a web framework? Which one? How to organize our client-side codebase? Should we write in Object Oriented or Functional style?

In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase.
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately to any JavaScript developer.

## Topics covered

* Web frameworks Fight! Express vs Hapi vs http.createServer
* Client side code - CommonJS vs AMD
* Code style - OO vs Functional
* Control Flow - Callbacks vs Promises
* Error handling - Domains?
